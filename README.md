#### Project 1: Martingale
The purpose of this assignment is to get you started programming in Python right away and to help provide you some initial feel for risk, probability and "betting." Purchasing a stock is, after all, a bet that the stock will increase in value.

#### Project 2: Optimize Something
In this project you will use what you learned about optimizers to optimize a portfolio. That means that you will find how much of a portfolio's funds should be allocated to each stock so as to optimize it's performance. We can optimize for many different metrics. In this version of the assignment we will maximize Sharpe Ratio.
